# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This webpage was created to provide a useful resource for storing notes on html, css, javascript and git in an accesible form.
It also provided through the development process some initial experience with web development languages and with github and version control tools.
